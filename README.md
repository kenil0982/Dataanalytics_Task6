About the Dataset

The provided code analyzes sales data over a specified period, offering insights into various aspects of the sales records. The dataset contains information such as the date of the sale, customer age, gender, product categories, and financial details of the transactions. This dataset enables us to explore customer demographics and sales trends.

Analysis Concepts

Data Preprocessing: The code begins by preparing the dataset for analysis. It creates a backup table, adds a new primary key "customer_id," and standardizes the "Customer_Gender" column by renaming values to "Male" and "Female."

Data Filtering: In this section, the code performs data filtering operations to answer specific questions. It selects and displays sub-categories of products and retrieves sales data for a particular customer ID (e.g., customer ID 1). Additionally, it retrieves sales records for a 25-year-old customer in Germany on a specific date.

Data Analysis

a. Price Distribution by Age: The code examines the distribution of customer ages and the products they purchase.

b. Profit Analysis: It identifies the most profitable year and the five most profitable months.

c. Customer Behavior: The code investigates customer behavior, including gender-based purchasing trends and sales in specific regions.

d. Category and Subcategory Profits: It determines the top 10 most profitable product categories and subcategories.

e. Revenue Analysis: The code analyzes which product categories contribute the most to revenue.

f. Age Group Analysis: Finally, it explores the age groups of male and female customers who make the most purchases.
